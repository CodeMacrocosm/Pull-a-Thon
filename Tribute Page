He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the <a href=" https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Research_and_Development_Organisation">Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Space_Research_Organisation"> Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)</a> and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.
